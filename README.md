# MP3-PLAYER-USING-VANILA JAVASCRIPT

As a tribute to singer Sidhu Moosewala, I designed and developed a sleek MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create an interactive and responsive UI. For the functionality of the player, I utilized vanilla JavaScript and deployed the Mp3 player using github pages.
